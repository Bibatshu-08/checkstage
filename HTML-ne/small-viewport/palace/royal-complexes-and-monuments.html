There are myths that he is a form of Lord Shiva too. This image was commissioned by King Pratap Malla in 1672 AD. Lord Hanuman was a great patron to Malla kings because they are believed to be the direct descendants of Shri Ram Chandra. The Malla kings, therefore, kept the image of Hanumans at their Durbars as a measure against tevils. He is also considered to be virtuous. Malla Kings also decorated their flags with Hanuman because it supposed to bring victory in wars. Another similar image of Hanuman is seen towards the western entrance to the palace complex, which is also known to be built by King Pratap Malla on the very said date.

The image belongs to the mighty monkey god from the Epic <b><i>Ramayana</i></b>. He was the most trusted servant of Lord Ram and performed superhuman activities throughout the war to help Lord Ram retain his beautiful wife Sita. There are myths that he is a form of Lord Shiva too. This image was commissioned by King Pratap Malla in 1672 AD. Lord Hanuman was a great patron to Malla kings because they are believed to be the direct descendants of Shri Ram Chandra. The Malla kings, therefore, kept the image of Hanumans at their Durbars as a measure against tevils. He is also considered to be virtuous. Malla Kings also decorated their flags with Hanuman because it supposed to bring victory in wars. Another similar image of Hanuman is seen towards the western entrance to the palace complex, which is also known to be built by King Pratap Malla on the very said date. These two Hanuman idols have been the reason behind the naming of the palace as <b>Hanumandhoka Palace</b>.<br><br>
